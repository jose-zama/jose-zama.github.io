## Adoption of kanban in BBC [^Senapathi]

- Quality improved
	- Number of live defects decrease by 24%
- Productivity improved
	- Lead time fell by 37%
	- Number of releases increased by a factor of 8
- 50% of teams previously using scrum
	- Limiting work in progress
	


[^Senapathi]: Senapathi & Srinivasan 2012. Understanding postÂ­adoptive agile usage.


## Productive increase [^Dyba]

- Two similar projects: one using XP; one using traditional development methods.
	- 42% increase in agile team, difference largest in the first iteration.
- Comparable software, different approaches
	- XP 337% more productive than V model
	- Lines of code, not feature

## Productive increase [^Dyba]

Also there are cases with decreased productivity 

- A XP team was 44% less productive than a traditional team.
- No change in productivity after agile introduction.

## Quality [^Senapathi]

- Overall in a XP project versus traditional, quality increasedin agile, although productivity an better user interface was done in traditional.

## Pair programming in students

Development took more time although the defects were lower. Students enjoyed more, improved desing, less code for same functionality. Improved learning, fewer querires.

## Test-first programming

Also development took more time, although test coverage was better. No difference in terms of fucntional correctness between first or late testing.

## Organisational Factors
