## Agile principles

#### The agile manifesto

The agile manifesto consist in the following four points:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotation.
4. **Responding a change** over following a plan

I always understood this manifesto as that both sides are important, although the left side are more..

There a principles behind this manifesto, which are:

1. To satisfy the client through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. To welcome changing requirements even late in development.
3. Delivering software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.
4. Business people and software developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
6. The most effective method to conveying information to and within the development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excelence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements and design emerges from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjust this behaviour accordingly.
